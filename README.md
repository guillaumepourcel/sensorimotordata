# Mocap CMU data

## Preprocessing (messy)

Adaptation of the notebook from https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmader/mocap-with-asf-amc/notebook relying on the code in https://github.com/CalciferZh/AMCParser/ for parsing the asf/amc data in the [CMU Mocap](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu). 

Additionally the data is pre-processed based on [1] (appendix A.3).

## Using the data and displaying it

The code for using the data and displaying the data is in skeleton.py and is illustrated in the notebook loadDisplay.ipynb.
